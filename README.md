### PyTorch Docker image

Ubuntu [14.04|16.04] + PyTorch + CUDA [7.5|8.0|none]


#### Requirements

In order to use this image you must have Docker Engine installed. Instructions
for setting up Docker Engine are
[available on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

#### Building

This image can be built on top of multiple different base images derived from
Ubuntu. Which base you choose depends on whether you have an NVIDIA
graphics card which supports CUDA and you want to use GPU acceleration or not.

If you are running Ubuntu, you can install proprietary NVIDIA drivers
[from the PPA](https://launchpad.net/~graphics-drivers/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)
and CUDA [from the NVIDIA website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
These are only required if you want to use GPU acceleration.

If you are running Windows or OSX then you will find it difficult/impossible to
use GPU acceleration due to the fact that containers run in a virtual machine.
Use the image without CUDA on those platforms.

##### With CUDA

Firstly ensure that you have a supported NVIDIA graphics card with the
appropriate drivers and CUDA libraries installed.

Build the image using the following command:

```sh
# If you have CUDA 7.5:
docker build -t pytorch ./cuda-7.5
# If you have CUDA 8.0:
docker build -t pytorch ./cuda-8.0
```

You will also need to install `nvidia-docker`, which we will use to start the
container with GPU access. This can be found at
[NVIDIA/nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker).

##### Without CUDA

Build the image using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t torch ./no-cuda
```

#### Usage

##### Running PyTorch scripts

It is also possible to run PyTorch programs inside a container using the
`python3` command. For example, if you are within a directory containing
some PyTorch project with entrypoint `main.py`, you could run it with
the following command:

```sh
nvidia-docker run --rm -it \
  --ipc=host \
  --volume=$PWD:/app \
  -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
  pytorch python3 main.py
```

The environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` controls which GPU device is
exposed to the program.

An important thing to remember is that the default working directory in the
container is `/app`. By creating a volume which maps the current
working directory to that location in the image, `python3` is able to find and
run our script.

The `--ipc=host` option is required for multiprocessing, as explained
at https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#docker-image.

##### Running graphical applications

If you are running on a Linux host, you can get code running inside the Docker
container to display graphics using the host X server (this allows you to use
OpenCV's imshow, for example). Here we describe a quick-and-dirty (but INSECURE)
way of doing this. For a more comprehensive guide on GUIs and Docker check out
http://wiki.ros.org/docker/Tutorials/GUI.

On the host run:

```sh
sudo xhost +local:root
```

You can revoke these access permissions later with `sudo xhost -local:root`.
Now when you run a container make sure you add the options `-e "DISPLAY"` and
`--volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw"`. This will provide the container
with your X11 socket for communication and your display ID. Here's an
example:

```sh
nvidia-docker run --rm -it \
  --ipc=host \
  --volume=$PWD:/app \
  -e CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 \
  -e "DISPLAY" --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
  pytorch python3 -c "import tkinter; tkinter.Tk().mainloop()"
```


##### Running Jupyter Notebook 

Build the image using the following command:

```sh
docker build -t notebook ./jupyter_python3
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 notebook
```
